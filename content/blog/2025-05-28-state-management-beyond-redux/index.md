# State Management in 2025: Beyond Redux

Redux has long been the go-to solution for state management in React applications. But as React has evolved, so have state management patterns and libraries. In this article, we'll explore modern alternatives and when you might want to use them.

## The Evolution of State Management

When React was first introduced, state management was primarily handled through component state. As applications grew more complex, libraries like Redux emerged to provide a centralized store and predictable state mutations. While Redux solved many problems, it also introduced boilerplate code and complexity.

Fast forward to 2025, and we have several robust alternatives that offer different trade-offs.

## Modern State Management Solutions

### 1. React Context + useReducer

React's built-in Context API and useReducer hook provide a Redux-like pattern without the need for external libraries:

```jsx
// Create a context
const CounterContext = React.createContext();

// Create a reducer
function counterReducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment':
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'decrement':
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      throw new Error(`Unhandled action type: ${action.type}`);
  }
}

// Provider component
function CounterProvider({ children }) {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(counterReducer, { count: 0 });
  const value = { state, dispatch };
  return (
    <CounterContext.Provider value={value}>
      {children}
    </CounterContext.Provider>
  );
}

// Custom hook for using the context
function useCounter() {
  const context = useContext(CounterContext);
  if (context === undefined) {
    throw new Error('useCounter must be used within a CounterProvider');
  }
  return context;
}
```

### 2. Zustand

Zustand offers a minimalist API with hooks-based state management:

```jsx
import create from 'zustand';

const useStore = create((set) => ({
  bears: 0,
  increasePopulation: () => set((state) => ({ bears: state.bears + 1 })),
  removeAllBears: () => set({ bears: 0 }),
}));

function BearCounter() {
  const bears = useStore((state) => state.bears);
  return <h1>{bears} around here...</h1>;
}

function Controls() {
  const increasePopulation = useStore((state) => state.increasePopulation);
  return <button onClick={increasePopulation}>Add bear</button>;
}
```

### 3. Jotai

Jotai takes an atomic approach to state management:

```jsx
import { atom, useAtom } from 'jotai';

const countAtom = atom(0);
const doubleCountAtom = atom((get) => get(countAtom) * 2);

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useAtom(countAtom);
  const [doubleCount] = useAtom(doubleCountAtom);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
      <h2>Double count: {doubleCount}</h2>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(c => c + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

### 4. Recoil

Developed by Facebook, Recoil provides a state management solution specifically designed for React:

```jsx
import { atom, selector, useRecoilState, useRecoilValue } from 'recoil';

const counterState = atom({
  key: 'counterState',
  default: 0,
});

const doubleCountState = selector({
  key: 'doubleCountState',
  get: ({get}) => {
    const count = get(counterState);
    return count * 2;
  },
});

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useRecoilState(counterState);
  const doubleCount = useRecoilValue(doubleCountState);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
      <h2>Double count: {doubleCount}</h2>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

## Choosing the Right Solution

The best state management solution depends on your specific needs:

- **Small to medium apps**: React's built-in Context and useReducer may be sufficient
- **Large applications with complex state**: Consider Zustand, Jotai, or Recoil
- **Team familiarity**: If your team knows Redux well, Redux Toolkit simplifies Redux usage
- **Performance concerns**: Jotai and Recoil offer granular re-renders and good performance

## Conclusion

Redux still has its place in the React ecosystem, but it's no longer the only viable option for complex state management. By understanding the trade-offs of different solutions, you can choose the right tool for your specific needs.

Remember that the best state management solution is often the simplest one that meets your requirements. Don't add complexity until you need it.
